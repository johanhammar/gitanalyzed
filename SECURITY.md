# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current version of GitAnalyzed will be checked with [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) and a best effort in writing secure, rational Bash will be undertaken.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

It's unclear to me if any user can add a security advisory report. If you can, do it! Else reach out if with a regular issue. Try to limit the amount of detail since the communication is public. I will then reach out so we can have a private conversation. Please prepare proof of the security vulnerability, and ideally a mitigation strategy.
